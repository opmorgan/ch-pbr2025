This study reports handedness of professional musicians (choir members, orchestra members, and composers). It uses a subset of another sample, matched 1-1 age and gender, as a control group. The controls were adults recruited from a medical practrice in a British tow.

Handedness was binned using a 0-split on Oldfield's laterality index, on the 10-item EHI scale. Right and left handers were then further divided, yielding four bins, strong/mixed by right/left, with this data reported for each group of musicians, and for the full control group (Table 1). From these numbers, the proportion of strong/mixed right/left handers across all musicians was calculated, and compared to the control group's. For the R/L comparison, groups were binned as (SR+MR)/(ML+SL); for the S/M comparison, as (SR+SL)/(ML+MR).
