This study reports on the same 77 students who were given tests of visuospatial ability in Peterson & Lansky 1980 [1], which is not included in this review. (It compared 1st to second year students -- I think that the first year vs. graduation rates for the same set of students is more relevant).

The authors report the frequency of left-handedness in enrolled architecture students, and in the same cohort on graduation. Here, the graduating class is treated as a "creative" group, and the enrolled class as a control group. The handedness measure is unspecified, but participants are classified as right or left handers.
