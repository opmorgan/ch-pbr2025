This study reports the handedness of 382 professional orchestra players. Handedness was measured by asking participants whether they were "right, left or mixed handed."

This study does not include a control group.

I will report the R/(M+L) frequency as "R/L" For odds ratios, I have preferred SR/SL, because it is a more direct measure of handedness direction, with less noise that could wash out differences. But, for a single frequency with no control group, the right vs. nonright percentage might be easier to interpret and compare with other studies.

I will report the (R+L)/M frequency as "S/M."
