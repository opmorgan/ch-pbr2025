Giotakos, O. (2004). Handedness and Hobby Preference. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 98(3), 869â€“872. https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.98.3.869-872 [[PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10cnetxAew8qvOYP8WkHjBFpI20JjLSuN/view?usp=sharing)]

The sample is 879 young men conscripted to the army. 58% strong righties, 3% strong left, 39% mixed. The author reports handedness frequency for those who prefer each of three hobbies: "Reading books, collecting, going to the cinema/theater"; "Art: playing music, drawing, handicraft." "Sports." Here, the frequency of lefties/mixedies preferring "Arts" is compared to the frequency preferring the other two hobbies combined. For R/L, "strong right" is compared to "strong left." For S/M, "strong right" + "strong left" is compared to "mixed."

Handedness measure: AHQ 12 action questionnaire, "strong right" and "strong left" were maximum and minumum scores; everyone else was "mixed."

### Load data from input file
```{r}
## Load and display input data
study <- "giotakos_2004"
input <- load_input(str_c(study, ".csv"))
pretty_table(input, title = str_c(study, ".csv"))
```

### Calculate effect sizes
```{r, results = "markup"}
es_study <- calculate_es(input, study, OR = T, RR = T, freq = F)
```
```{r}
## Display study results
es_study %>% display_study_es()

## Add study results to full results table
es <- es %>% add_row(es_study)
```
