This file describes the data appendix included with the JEP's published version of "The Wages of Sinistrality," by Joshua Goodman.

I first clean the raw data from each of the underlying five data sets, creating a cleaned Stata version for each individual data set.

1) NLS-C files 

default86.dct 		- Raw data from the NLSY79 Children and Young Adults study.
defaultmom.dct 		- Raw data from the NLSY79 on mothers of those in the Children and Young Adults study.
handedness86.do 	- Program to clean and merge the raw data from default86.dct and defaultmom.dct.
handedness86.dta	- The cleaned data that results from running handedness86.do on default86.dct and defaultmom.dct.

2) NLSY79 files

default79.dct 		- Raw data from the NLSY79.
handedness79.do 	- Program to clean and merge the raw data from default79.dct.
handedness79.dta	- The cleaned data that results from running handedness79.do on default79.dct.

3) NLSY97 files

default97.dct 		- Raw data from the NLSY97.
handedness97.do 	- Program to clean and merge the raw data from default97.dct.
handedness97.dta	- The cleaned data that results from running handedness97.do on default97.dct.

4) NCDS58 files 

ncds012345.dta 		- Raw data from waves 0-5 of the National Child Development Study.
handedness58.do 	- Program to clean the raw data from ncds012345.dta.
handedness58.dta	- The cleaned data that results from running handedness58.do on ncds012345.dta. 

5) BCS70 files

bcs01236.dta 		- Raw data from waves 0-3 and 6 of the British Cohort Study.
handedness70.do 	- Program to clean the raw data from bcs01236.dta.
handedness70.dta	- The cleaned data that results from running handedness70.do on bcs01236.dta. 

I then append all five of those files into a single file and do some final cleaning using the "create" sub-routine in lefty_analyze.do.

The result is the final data set handedness.dta, where the variable sample takes on values:

0 = NLS-C (full sample)
1 = NLs-C (sibling fixed effects sub-sample, for OLS analysis)
2 = NLS-C (sibling fixed effects sub-sample, for FE analysis)
3 = US sample (NLSY79 + NLSY97)
4 = NLSY79
5 = NLSY97
6 = UK sample (NCDS58 + BCS70)
7 = NCDS58
8 = BCS70

The remaining sub-routines of lefty_analyze.do generate the tables in the online appendix.

Tables in the main body of the JEP paper are generated by running JEP_Tables.do on handedness.dta.
