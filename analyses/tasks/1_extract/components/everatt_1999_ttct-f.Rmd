Everatt, J., Steffert, B., & Smythe, I. (1999). An eye for the unusual: Creative thinking in dyslexics. Dyslexia, 5(1), 28â€“46. https://doi.org/10.1002/(SICI)1099-0909(199903)5:1<28::AID-DYS126>3.0.CO;2-K

36 participants (18 dyslexic; of whatever handedness) completed the AUT and TTCT-F (picture construction), and were scored on fluency. The authors report simple correlation coefficients (rho) for both tests.

AUT Fluency: rho(35) = -.03 (lefty advantage)
TTCT-F Fluency: rho(35) = -0.19 (lefty advantage)
