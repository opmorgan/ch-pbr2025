Newland, G. A. (1981). Differences between Left- and Right-Handers on a Measure of Creativity. Perceptual and Motor Skills, 53(3), 787â€“792. https://doi.org/10.2466/pms.1981.53.3.787

Table 1 reports means, SDs, and Ns for right and left handers on Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and Elaboration.

TTCT scores:
"The Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (Torrance, 1974), Figural
Form B, was used to measure creativity. This three-part test of picrure con-
struction is scored on four subscales of Fluency, Flexibility, Originality, and
Elaboration. The tests were scored by a trained rater who was unaware of the
subjects' handedness."
